# Train Test Split

The train-test split is a technique for evaluating the performance of a machine learning algorithm. It can be used for classification or regression problems and can be used for
any supervised learning algorithm. The procedure involves taking a dataset and dividing it into two subsets. The train-test split procedure is used to estimate the performance of machine learning algorithms when they are used to make predictions on data not used to train the model.
