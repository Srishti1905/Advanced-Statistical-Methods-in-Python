# Feature Selection
Feature Selection is the process where you automatically or manually select those features which contribute most to your prediction variable or output in which you are interested 
in. Having irrelevant features in your data can decrease the accuracy of the models and make your model learn based on irrelevant features.

# Feature Scaling
Feature scaling is a method used to normalize the range of independent variables or features of data. In data processing, it is also known as data normalization and is generally 
performed during the data preprocessing step.
